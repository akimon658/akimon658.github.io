[{"content":"According to the Disqus help page, we can override the language by adding this.\nvar disqus_config = function () { this.language = \u0026#34;ja\u0026#34;; }; So, if you want to change the language of Disqus by the page\u0026rsquo;s, adding the following code to the disqus_config of your theme or official Disqus template should effect.\nvar disqus_config = function () { this.language = \u0026#39;{{ .Lang }}\u0026#39;; }; However, the variable name disqus_config would be changed if you used hugo --minify so you couldn\u0026rsquo;t change the language.\nAgainst minify One day, I realized that disqus_config should be called from somewhere because it was just declared in the above code. Therefore, I visited akimon658-githug-io.disqus.com/embed.js and found this.\nvar _config = window.disqus_config; So I tried the following code, and it works correctly.\nvar disqus_config = function () { window.disqus_config = \u0026#39;{{ .Lang }}\u0026#39;; }; window objects and global variables We can use window.foo same as a global variable foo.

Copy the token? Or use WSLg? These ways are not wrong, but it will be better to use the host\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nHere is how to set it:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser path/to/browser priority Example:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe 1 That’s all if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any browser in WSL. Even if you have installed one, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you have to think seriously about priority because you can configure default by the following command.\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser Now, you can use the browser of Windows as WSL\u0026rsquo;s default.\n","date":"2021-12-31","permalink":"https://akimon658.github.io/en/p/2021/wsl-default-browser/","tags":null,"title":"How to use the browser in Windows as WSL's default"},{"content":"When you use Gitpod, you can use gitpod/workspace-full. It is enough for development most case. However, I\u0026rsquo;d like to use a morphological analysis engine called MeCab with Golang, so I tried to use an image I\u0026rsquo;ve created in advance. However, I got stuck on permission, so I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article.\nAbout Gitpod It is a development environment that we can use on a browser.

So running sudo will solve it, but the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the command. By the way, it won\u0026rsquo;t occur in the official image because it sets the USER properly.\nSolution FROMakimon658/go-mecab-neologd:latestRUN go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\  chmod 777 -R / gochmod 777 is a command that allows all users to read, write, and execute to the specified location, and -R is an option that applies it to the contents of the target directory as well. Set this where you need it.

It\u0026rsquo;s long, so I\u0026rsquo;d like to replace it with ~ like Bash.\nPrepare a profile You can customize your PowerShell with $profile. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist by default, so you need to run touch $profile.\nCustomize To customize the prompt, use function prompt. Here is a built-in one.\nfunction prompt { $(if (Test-Path variable:/PSDebugContext) { \u0026#39;[DBG]: \u0026#39; } else { \u0026#39;\u0026#39; }) + \u0026#39;PS \u0026#39; + $(Get-Location) + $(if ($NestedPromptLevel -ge 1) { \u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026#39; }) + \u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026#39; } Source: about Prompts - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs\nIt seems using $(Get-Location) to get the current path, but we can\u0026rsquo;t use it as a string (even if we use $pwd).
